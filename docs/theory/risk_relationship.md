# Understanding and Measuring Risk & Relationships

## How to Estimate Risk
Risks have various meanings and measures. In general, risk is the likelihood or value of loss of funds. All stocks are impacted by two types of risk:
- firm specific risk - Things specific to a firm that will have negative impact on revenue generation. 
- market risk - things specific to the market in which a firm operates in - it affects all firms. 

Total Risk = Market Risk + Firm Specific Risk

A generally accepted measure of the **total risk of stocks** is their volatility (standard deviation). Volatility can be approximated as risk - the greater the difference between the return of stock j, $r_j$, and its expected return $E[r_j]$, the greater the volatility of stock. Therefore, the volatility of a stock is directly proportional to this difference. Deviations of returns $(r_{j} - E[r_{j}])$. The volatility is a factor of the method used to determine expected returns. The sum of all deviations is equal to 0, for the mean expected return method.
